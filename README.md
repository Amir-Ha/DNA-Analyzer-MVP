# DNA-Analyzer-MVP

DNA Analyzer is a C++ project that I worked on during the ExcellenTeam training bootcamp,
its goal is to load, analyze and manipulate DNA sequences.
# How it works
The system interacts with the user through a CLI (Command Line Interface) that uses the standard I/O.
Using that interface, the user will be able to load DNA sequences from files, to analyze them, to manipulate them (e.g., by extracting sequence slices or by modifying the sequence), and to store modified sequences and reports.
